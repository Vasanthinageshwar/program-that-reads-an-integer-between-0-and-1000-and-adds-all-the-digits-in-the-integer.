(Sum the digits in an integer) Write a program that reads an integer between 0 and
1000 and adds all the digits in the integer. For example, if an integer is 932, the sum
of all its digits is 14.
Hint: Use the % operator to extract digits, and use the / operator to remove the
extracted digit. For instance, 932 % 10 = 2 and 932 / 10 = 93.

CODE:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Q4 {
public static void main(String[] args) {

System.out.print(&quot;Enter a number between 0 and 1000: &quot;);
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int n = sc.nextInt();
int sum = 0;

while (n &gt; 0) {
sum += (n % 10);
n /= 10;
}

System.out.println(&quot;The sum of the digits is &quot; + sum);
}
}
